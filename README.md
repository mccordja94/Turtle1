# Turtle1
drawTriangle was also fairly easy. It took me 20-25 minutes and I only stuttered on making the turtle use the penUp method. I did use additional resources to find the angles of equilateral triangles.

Pseudocode
•	Create public void drawTriangle (int length)
•	Face turtle in the right direction which is 150 degrees
•	Send turtle forward (length)
•	Face turtle to 270
•	Send turtle forward (length)
•	Face turtle to 30
•	Send turtle forward (length)

drawStar did take me some time, about 60 minutes. I got confused when I did not have my turtle class in the same location on my computer as my main method. Kathy helped me with that. She also helped me to create an int to store the value of the length of the sides of the star. This was key to making the star fluctuate in size. I again used outside resources to determine the angles of the pentagram (star).
